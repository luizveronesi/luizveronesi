### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a highly experienced software engineer with 20+ years of experience. Over the course of my career, I have fulfilled several roles, contributing to all stages of the software development lifecycle, including business analysis, task prioritization, interface design, deployment, support, project and personnel management, pre-sales, and, of course, CODING, which I just love!

Feel free to reach me and use everything here as much as you want!
